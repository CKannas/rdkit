= Building on Linux =

== Getting Ready ==
 * Required packages:
   ** flex and bison. These are frequently already installed if you have the various pieces of the development environment installed
   ** The following are required if you are planning on using the Python wrappers:
     *** The python headers. This probably means that you need to install the python-dev package (or whatever it's called) for your linux distribution.

 * extra pieces for cmake:
   ** download support for bison and flex from tracker: http://public.kitware.com/Bug/view.php?id=4018 and put somewhere cmake can find it (I used /usr/share/cmake).

== Installing Boost ==
  * download the boost source distribution from [http://www.boost.org the boost web site]
  * extract the source to a _non-temporary_ location on your machine, you're going to need it to build the RDKit as well as boost. (e.g. `/usr/local/src/boost_1_39_0`)
  * The following are required if you are planning on using the Python wrappers:
    ** build and install the required boost shared libraries: 
     *** `cd $BOOST`
     *** Building on 32 bit systems: `bjam  --with-thread --with-python release install`
     *** Building on 64 bit systems: `bjam --with-thread --with-python address-model=64 release install`
    If you have any problems with this step, check the boost [http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html installation instructions].

== Building the Code ==
  * follow the Installing Boost instructions above.
  * environment variables:
    ** RDBASE: the root directory of the RDKit distribution (e.g. ~/RDKit)
    ** BOOST_ROOT: should be wherever you extracted the boost source (e.g. /usr/local/src/boost_1_39_0)
    ** LD_LIBRARY_PATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE/bin and wherever the boost shared libraries were installed
    ** The following are required if you are planning on using the Python wrappers:
      *** PYTHON_ROOT: wherever python is installed (e.g. /usr)
      *** PYTHON_VERSION: the first two digits of the python version (e.g. 2.5, *not* 2.5.1)
      *** PYTHONPATH: make sure it includes $RDBASE
  * Building:
    ** cd to $RDBASE
    ** `mkdir build`
    ** `cd build`
    ** `cmake ../Code`
    ** `make`
    this builds all libraries, regression tests, and wrappers (by default). 
    ** `make install`

== Testing the Build (optional, but recommended) ==
  * cd to $RDBASE/build
  * ctest
  * cd to $RDBASE/rdkit and do: `python $RDBASE/rdkit/TestRunner.py test_list.py`
